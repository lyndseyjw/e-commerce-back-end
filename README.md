## General Back End Server Routes & Database For E-Commerce Platforms

This app is for e-commerce sites that already have a front end but need a database to store product data organized by category & assigned to tags. These data tables have many-to-many relationships that allow the merging of data across different products. 

This project is a good template for how to organize e-commerce back end data & contains server routes that can be connected to any UI. This is a very dynamic site that can be used for any e-commerce site.
